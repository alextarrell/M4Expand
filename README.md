# M4Expand
An M4 plugin for Sublime

Runs all selected text through [M4](https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/m4.html) for maximum productivity and profit.

Since the bulk of the work is actually performed by M4, you'll need to have it installed and on your PATH. If you're not sure whether M4 is installed, run 'm4 --version' at your system's default Terminal/Command Prompt/whatever.
